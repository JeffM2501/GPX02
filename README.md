If you want to develop on Linux you will need to use Wine, that's all there is to it. Both Windows and MacOSX IDEs can build Linux binary packages.


Coding

The code for the system is done in C# and uses ether the .net or mono runtimes on end user systems. The Unity IDE packages up the run-times that are needed on each platform so there are no end user dependencies.
